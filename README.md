I am currently pursuing a degree in **Computer Information Technology** with a minor in **Information Security** at Northern Kentucky University. My passion lies in **networking, system administration**, and all things **IT**.

This semester, I've been diving deep into **Cisco Networking**, **VMware**, **server administration**, and more!

In addition, I'm working as an **IT Co-Op** at **Mubea**, where I’m gaining hands-on experience that is shaping me into a skilled IT professional.


I would love to get involved with various **IT communities** where I can feel more engaged and contribute meaningfully!
